# STEPS

## Fetch todos & display them

- [x] Make a TodoList Component
- [x] fetch the todos
  - [x] useState (store todos -> initial state)
  - [x] useEffect
  - [x] axios get
  - [x] We need api (fake api)
  - [x] set the state
- [x] (SUCCESS) map the todos -> JSX
  - [x] Todo Component
- [x] (ERRORS) display some feedback -> JSX
  - [x] Error Component
- [x] (LOADING) display a spinner
  - [x] Loading component

## Options

Is the responsibility displaying something (UI)

- Components -> Todo

Is the responsibility a logic that has nothing to do with React?

- Function -> format a string, do Math, display readable output

Do you need React behaviour for some logic you want to delegate?

- useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback
- Other library hooks: useParams
- Hooks -> fetching, effects, validation
